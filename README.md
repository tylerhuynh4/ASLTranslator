# ASL Translator

   **Overview**:
   This is a Real-time AI system that can recognize and token ASL signage
   to convert them English which can then be translated into multitudes of languages as well.

   The purpose is to make ASL more accessible to those who aren't well versed in the language to reduce many
   communication barriers by using video input, computer vision, machine learning, and a dedicated
   language/speech pipeline. 
   
   While there are existing ASl translators out there, none contains ASL signage
   conversions having the ability to convert, then translate to other languages.
   
   **Tech Stack**:
